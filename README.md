# biotic_interactions

Scripts to detect tables containing biotic interactions in Pensoft's XMLs. Only table_annotator.R needs to be run, it sources the other file containing all functions.

We use Pensoft's Annotator with a custom ontology, based on the Relations Ontology (RO) to detect biotic interactions either in the table captions or table contents.

Out of 6321 tables, 233 were found to contain possible biotic interactions.
